# Chatter! Chatroom Application 🎉💬

## Overview

The Chatroom Application is a real-time messaging platform that allows users to connect, chat, and interact with each other through a dynamic and engaging interface. Built with **Spring Boot** for the backend and **WebSocket** for real-time communication, this app enables users to join a virtual chatroom, send messages, and receive notifications instantly. 🚀

This application is perfect for any scenario where a real-time chat feature is needed, such as social platforms, customer support systems, or team collaboration tools. 🤝

## Features ✨

- **Real-time Messaging**: All messages are sent and received instantly, without the need to refresh the page. ⚡
- **User Identification**: Users can join the chatroom with a unique username, and their name is displayed for everyone in the chat. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
- **Colorful User Experience**: Each user is assigned a unique color to differentiate their messages in the chatroom. 🌈
- **Join/Leave Notifications**: When a user joins or leaves the chatroom, everyone in the room is notified. 🚪👋

## How It Works 🔧

1. **Connect to the Chatroom**: When the user visits the page, they are prompted to enter a username. Once entered, they are automatically connected to the chatroom. 🖥️
2. **Sending Messages**: Users can type a message in the input box and hit "Send" to broadcast their message to the chatroom. 📝✉️
3. **Real-time Updates**: As soon as a message is sent, it appears in the chatroom for all users to see. The page updates without requiring a refresh. 🔄

## Technologies Used ⚙️

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with WebSocket and STOMP for real-time messaging) 🖥️

- **Database**: No database is used in this version (messages are stored temporarily) 💾
